# mnist-neural-net
A vanilla neural net implemented with NumPy set up to train on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) dataset. Instead of the original, I used a pickled version of the dataset which can be downloaded [here](http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz).

I trained the current model to ~97.4% accuracy and haven't spent much time on hyperparameter tuning, as my main goal with writing this code was to gain a better understanding of the algorithms involved.
